**INTERCEPTION ATTACKS**:ok
3 of the most common interception attacks are __, _ _, __:mitm session replay mitb
(ACRONYM) MITM:man in the middle
Threat actor is positioned in a communcations between two parties, _ _ _ _ attack:man in the middle
The goal of an MITM is to __ on the conversation or __ one of the parties:eavesdrop impersonate
A typical MITM has __ phases:2
The first phase is __ the traffic:intercepting
A common form of interception is for threat actor to pretend to be web app by altering _ _ in an _ address:packet headers ip
When users attempt to accesss a URL connected to the app, they are instead sent to the __ __:attacker website
A __ attack is a variation of a MITM attack:replay
Whereas a MITM attack alters & then __ the tranmission __:sends immediately
A __ attack makes a __ of the legitimate transmission before sending:replay copy
The __ is used later when the MITM "__" the transmission:copy replays
An attack which involves intercepting & using the session ID to impersonate a user, _ _:session replay
A _ _ is a unique number that web server assigns a specific user for duration of user's visit:session ID
Session IDs are usually __ bits in length & are hashed using a secure hash function:128
Threat actors use several techniques for stealing an active session ID(OK):Ok
These include network attacks, such as _ & _ _ between 2 users:hijacks altered communication
These also include endpoint attacks, such as, _ _ _, _, & malicious _ _:cross site scripting trojan javascript coding
_ _ _ _ attack intercepts communication between parties to steal or manipulate the data:man in the browser
Whereas a MITM attack occurs between 2 __:endpoints
MITB occurs between the web _ & the underlying _:browser computer
MITB attack seeks to intercept & manipulate the comms between _ _ & _ _ of the computer:web browser security mechanism
Threat actors gain several advantages in a MITB attack(OK):ok
1.) Most MITB attacks are distributed through _ _ _:trojan browser extensions
2.) An infected MITB might remain __ for months until triggered:dormant
3.) MITB software resides exclusively within the _ _, making it difficult to detect:web browser
**LAYER 2** ATTACKS:ok
2 Common Layer 2 attacks are _ _ & _ _ _ attacks:arp poisoning media access control
Threat actors change data stored in ARP cache to point to different IP address, _ _:arp poisoning
__, which is deceiving by impersonating another's identity:spoofing
ARP poisoning uses __:spoofing
Two common attacks involving MAC addresses are MAC __ & MAC __:cloning flooding
Threat actors spoof MAC address on their device, send packets onto network which changes target MAC addr, _ _:mac cloning
A _ _ attack is another attack based on spoofing, MAC cloning, & MAC addr table of switch:mac flooding
Switch is overflow with spoofed Ethernet packets so that every packet contains different SOURCE MAC addr, _ _:mac flooding
MAC flooding quickly consumes all the __ for the MAC address table, called the _ _ _:memory content addressable memory
One MAC table is full, switch enters _-_ & broadcasts frames to all __:fail-open ports
Like ARP-poisoning a __ attack substitutes a DNS address so that computer is silently redirected to different device:dns
A successful DNS attack has _ consequences:2
The goal of a DNS attack is __ __:url redirection
Instead of users reaching their intended site, they are redirected to another site, _ _:url redirection
The second goal of a DNS attack is to create low _ _:domain reputation
An email service that has sent spam or unwanted bulk email has a low _ score:reputation
Can indentify a domain used for distributing malware or launching attacks, _ _:domain reputation
DNS attacks include DNS _ & DNS _:poisoning hijacking
Attack that modifies a local lookup table on a device to point to a different domain, _ _:dns poisoning
DNS poisoning involves modifying the local _ _ :hosts table
In Linux the hosts table is located at _:/etc/hosts
Attack to infect an external DNS server with IP addr that point to malicious sites, _ _:dns hijacking
DNS hijacking has the advantage of redirecting __ users accessing the server:all
Attackers attempt to exploit protocol flaw & convince authentic DNS server to accept fradulent DNS entries, _ _:DNS hijacking
DNS HIJACKING STEPS:ok
1.) __ sends request to a valid DNS server asking to resolve name of __ website:attacker malicious
2.) DNS server asks the responsible _ _ , which is the attacker's address:name server
3.) Attacker's name server sends the IP of the __ website & all of it __ to the valid DNS server:malicious records
4.) Any requests to the valid DNS server will now respond with __ IP addresses:hackers 
The advantage of DNS POISONING is that __ domains __ victim uses is controlled by threat actor:all one
The advantage of DNS HIJACKING is that __ domains are controlled, but __ users access DNS server are __:fewer all redirected
(ACRONYM) DDOS:distributed denial of service
thousands of sources producing a torrent of bogus requests, _ _ _ _:distributed denial of service
(ACRONYM) OT:operational technology
Endpoints that can be programmed & have an IP addr, _ _ :operational technology
**SCRIPTING**:ok
4 types of programs to perform scripting attacks, _ _ _ _:powershell python vba bash
Admin tasks in Powershell are performed by __:cmdlets
CMDLETS are specialized __ classes that implement a specific operation:.net
Because most apps flag powershell as trusted, its actions are rarely __:scrutinized
(ACRONYM) VBA:visual basic for applications
An event-driven Microsoft programming language, _ _ _:visual basic for applications
VBA is used to create __:macros
A series of instructions that can be grouped together as a single command, __:macro
